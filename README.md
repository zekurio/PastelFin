# NeutralFin Theme

NeutralFin is a custom Jellyfin theme based on [lscambo13's ElegantFin](https://github.com/lscambo13/ElegantFin), featuring a sleek black and grey color scheme for a more neutral and modern look.

The preview images also use the [Jellyfin Lucide](https://github.com/KartoffelChipss/Jellyfin-Lucide) theme for more modern icons.

For this theme to look best, we also recommend enabling backdrops in your Jellyfin settings.
